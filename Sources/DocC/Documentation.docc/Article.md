# Why commenting is must?

The time we spend reading the code is over 10x more than writing it. This article explains Why do ne need to use Documentation.


## Overview

Regardless of how concise and clear your code is, it cannot be 100% self-documenting. What seems crystal clear to you at the time of writing, might be totally confusing to a reader. This means that code cannot completely replace comments.

Hubris: “I can understand my code well, the rest is not my problem” or “Good code speaks for itself”.
Laziness.
Deadlines. Summa referencing a function ``DocCDuplicated/descriptionExample()``

### Types of Comments
By their purpose, all comments can be abstracted into `four` groups:
Apdiye konjam **Bold** and *Italic*. Use code blocks for multi line
```
Documentary
Functional
Explanatory
Stress relief
```

Same with bullets (can use \*,+,-)
* Documentary
* Functional
* Explanatory
* Stress relief

Same with numbering

2. UnderTaker
3. John Cena
4. HHH

A code block example 

```swift
struct Sightseeing: Activity {
    func perform(with sloth: inout Sloth) -> Speed {
        sloth.energyLevel -= 10
        return .slow
    }
}
```

Table Example:
Sloth speed | Description
--- | ---
`slow` | Moves slightly faster than a snail.
`medium` | Moves at an average speed.
`fast` | Moves faster than a hare.
`supersonic` | Moves faster than the speed of sound.
